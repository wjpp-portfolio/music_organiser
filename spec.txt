# Purpose
To easily collate relevant files for rehersal and gigging

## Functionality
- Create setlists
- Export files for setlists
- Save and retrieve setlists
- Edit setlists
- Add song(s) to library
- Delete song(s) from library
- Edit song(s) in library
- Indicate when content is missing from library


## Design considerations:
- Maintain library health
- Future compatability: Perhaps MuseScore is no longer available, or instead of PDF some other format makes more sense.  The app must support different and unknown softwares and file-types

# Out of scope
Use by other people

# Implementation

On close ask to save set-list if not saved (you can export a setlist without saving)

On pressing mid 'x' while set-item is selected, remove it from set window
On pressing mid 'x' while library-item is selected, ask to remove it from library

Setlists dropdown has item 'Add New...' which will create a new set object. It will prompt for name when clicking 'Save'.  You can create a setlist without saving it

Delete setlist will prompt for confirmation

'Export files' will open new window with progress list.  It will display missing files and problems.  Includes button to open file directory
